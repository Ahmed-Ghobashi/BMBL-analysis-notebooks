# Sketch-based analysis
This sketch-based analysis workflow is used to analyze a 1.3 million cell dataset of the developing mouse brain, freely available from 10x Genomics. To analyze large datasets like this, a standard workflow is challenging, slow, and requires a significant amount of memory. This workflow is highly scalable to extremely large datasets.
